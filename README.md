> Battle a bunch of enemies in the arena and dungeon to unlock loots and become a legendary hero.

The Land of Mydoslyne is the land of Honor, Fame, and Glory. Owned and ruled by its people, where they live by the virtues of Courage, Pride and Liberality. Known for its events, stories, and memories throughout the years.&#x20;

There are different tribes in every elemental region. The Flames of Phoenetra Tribe, The Waves of Seagandia Tribe, The Great Stone of Yagamuth Tribe, The Breeze of Kuzityre Tribe, The Beam of Arkansun Tribe, and The Depth Void Tribe. Although Monsters are present in the Land of Mydoslyne, the tribes go for the hunt, to provide for their needs and to keep the land safe from the evils of the depth. There are Heroes that represent their tribe, these heroes are the ones that fight alongside others for the safety of their land. The tribes forge their own weapons to battle. Weapons that aid them in their battles, to use it against the forces that ravage their land, , as well as for their game of fame through the battles they do. There's more to the eye than just slaying monsters, each tribe chooses their representatives for what we call an arena fight, each tribe participates in an arena fight to prove who is the best fighter there is, in a team of 3, these warriors fight fearlessly together to defeat the opposing team. To earn medallions, trophies and to show who has more power in the Land of Mydoslyne. Nothing else feels great than being called the best warriors of the Land of Mydoslyne, to be acknowledged as the fiercest, bravest, and smartest. To earn riches, glory, fame and to earn the right to be called the greatest hero in the land of Mydoslyne.

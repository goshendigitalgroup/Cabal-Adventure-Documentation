# ðŸ§—â™‚ Token Vesting Schedule

Since preserving market equilibrium is a difficult task, We developed this concept as a viable solution that will benefit both our community and investors

Development: 10% unlocked after TGE, then 10% quarterly

Seed Sale: 10% unlocked after TGE, then 10% quarterly

Private Sale: 20% unlocked after TGE, then 20% quarterly

Public: 100% unlocked after TGE

Liquidity: 25% unlocked after TGE, then 10% monthly over 5 months then 5% monthly for another 5 months (all unlocked tokens will be locked for 10 years to their respective LP pair)

Game Rewards: 10% unlocked after TGE, then 10% quarterly

Reserved: 6 months fully locked after TGE, then 10% quarterly

Team & Advisor: 1 year fully locked after TGE, then 25% quarterly

Marketing: 10% unlocked after TGE, then 10% quarterly

Airdrop & Event Rewards: 10% unlocked after TGE, then 5% quarterly

Angel Investor Sale: 5% unlocked after TGE, then 5% quarterly

We selected this approach for a number of factors. to protect everyone from a market crash, to be fair to our private and public sales investors, and to maintain stable market pricing.

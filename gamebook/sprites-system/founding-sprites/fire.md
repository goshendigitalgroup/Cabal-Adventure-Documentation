# Fire

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/fire.png)

This creature burns like a wildfire, leaving traces of ashes to its path whenever it is angered. Pyixue is known to blasts flames that will burn anything it focuses on attacking. Able to deliver massive burn damage and is not a force to be reckoned with. If you see something burning in the fire, Pyixue is there waiting to attack.

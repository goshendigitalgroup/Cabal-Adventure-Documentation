# ðŸŽ– Buffs and Debuffs

There are status effects in Heroes Uprising, much like in many other games. A good influence is known as "Buffs," whereas a negative effect is known as "Debuffs". They may be used on your allies or your adversaries by using Ability Cards. Heroes impacted by specific status effects have a floating symbol over their heads that shows which status effect is active.

# ðŸ—º Guild Expedition

![](../../.gitbook/assets/Expedition.jpg)

The world has numerous vast undiscovered dungeons left behind by an ancient civilization now long gone, filled to the brim with untold treasures, but this task is impossible for a single hero, so the hero must form a party with other heroes to accomplish this daunting task and reap the rewards.

## Guild Expedition Mechanic

{% hint style="info" %}
Every 15 days the guild expedition is available for 24 hours limited to 2 entries, 50 players must participate, one player is assigned per floor, every enemy on each floor is randomized as well as what floor the boss is gonna be in if one player fails the expedition then the whole guild receives no reward. So all guild members must cooperate to complete the tasks.

# ðŸ”‘ Security Features

## Logging in-game

You need to create an account using a metamask wallet on the marketplace. Then you need to verify your email to use the marketplace without limits. Once it's verified, you can log in to the game using the email that is connected to your metamask on the marketplace.

## Gifting

Players who want to gift any in-game asset will have to turn on 2FA first. And the player receiving the asset won't be able to earn from it for _24_ hours prior to the gifting.

## Renting/Scholarship

Players who rented out their teams will be held in the escrow wallet. We maximize renting/scholarship security to protect scholars/renting from managers or those who list an asset for rent on the marketplace or give a scholar a scholarship.

### Split Scroll

If you are a manager and you want to give a scholarship to a picked scholar. Read the explanation below.

{% hint style="info" %}
The manager will create a team and pick 3 heroes equipped with 3 swords that will fit as a team. After that, the manager will need the public address of the scholar. Once the manager gets the public address of the scholar, the manager will click the rent button of the team that was created earlier and pick Split Scroll renting. The manager will adjust the profit sharing. Then the manager will put the scholar's public address and press continue. Then a window will pop up with a link to the contract that needs a scholar's confirmation. So the manager will send the link to the scholar. Once the scholar opens the link and accepts or declines the terms and conditions of the contract, the manager will get a notification that the scholar accepts or declines the contract. Once the scholar accepts it, the manager will acknowledge the contract and confirm the contract itself. Then the scholar will be received by the team immediately.

## Contract Termination

Contract termination occurs when the manager or the scholar terminates the contract, all the assets rented by the scholar will go back to their manager. And they will be prompted by an email connected to their account with a summary of their earnings throughout the renting period.

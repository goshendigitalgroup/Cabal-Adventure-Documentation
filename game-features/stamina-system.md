# âš¡ Stamina System

Stamina is the main factor in earning RAP in Heroes Uprising, once they start playing they will receive 30 stamina per day that will reset every 00:00 GMT +8. Once the player enters the Arena Battle Royal, a stamina point will be consumed whether the player was successful or not.

The amount of stamina that players receive prevents them from earning a huge amount of RAP, as it can affect our in-game economy. Although players have a way to increase their stamina limit per day. They can do this by obtaining more swords and storing them in their respective wallet as well as being able to join a guild.

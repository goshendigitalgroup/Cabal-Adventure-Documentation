# ðŸ–± Fusion System

## Sword Fusion

To reduce the number of minted swords, we'll add our NFT Burning system. Integrate

Integrate allows users to merge any swords to create a single random or pure element sword this feature will be free from transaction fees

There are two types of integration, each of which differs in terms of the user's preferred method of performing one.



### Dual Fusion

You can fuse 2 random swords into 1 sword with a low chance of getting pure elements and cards.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Fused unto 1 sword with 90% chance random elements and cards, 10% pure element and cards.
{% endhint %}

### Quad Fusion

You can fuse 4 random swords into 1 sword with a higher chance of getting pure elements and cards.

{% hint style="info" %}
Fused unto 1 sword with 60% chance random elements and cards, 40% pure element and cards.
{% endhint %}

### Sword Fusion Requirements

| Type        | Swords | SGN | RAE  |
| ----------- | ------ | --- | ---- |
| Dual Fusion | 2      | 2   | 1000 |
| Quad Fusion | 4      | 2   | 500  |

## Sprite Fusion

If fusion does not result in a rarity increase, then the Sprite you receive will be the same grade as the ones used but will have a random element. The Sprites used for fusion will be automatically burned.

| From      | To        | Probability |
| --------- | --------- | ----------- |
| Common    | Uncommon  | 20%         |
| Uncommon  | Rare      | 17%         |
| Rare      | Epic      | 14%         |
| Epic      | Legendary | 11%         |
| Legendary | Mythic    | 8%          |
| Mythic    | Exotic    | 5%          |

Element outcome is dependent on the percentage drop, as will be shown in this chart.

| Elements | Probability    |
| -------- | -------------- |
| Fire     | 16.6666666667% |

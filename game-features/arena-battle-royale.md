# ⚔ Arena Battle Royale

### Triple Category Matchmaking

1. Brawl Category - This category is for free-to-play features, this will be a practice category or a training category for those who are testing their teams. Players will not earn any MMR points nor they will earn any rewards from battling.&#x20;
2. Classic Category - This category applies to the free-to-play feature also, this will be an intense player vs player matchmaking but players will grind from 0 MMR to 750 MMR to earn rewards.&#x20;
3. Ranked Category - This category will not apply to free-to-play players, and it is also required to join a Guild to access this feature. Players’ MMR is at stake here, so basically Ranked Category is for competitive players who invested their way in to play for this category.

### Battle System

The Heroes Uprising fighting system is a turn-based card game in which your squad of three heroes must eliminate all your opponent’s heroes in order to win. Each turn, a player must play cards wisely in order to increase their chances of winning.

### Battle Stage

Once players find a match on our matchmaking system by clicking the fight button, the battle will begin shortly;

* At the start of each round, cards will be added at random.&#x20;
* Buffs that affect attack sequence will be applied next round&#x20;
* Effect of each card will be applied once it’s used during the round&#x20;
* Heroes will attack their closes target except when using cards that allow the hero to attack furthest or behind the closes target.

## Seasonal System

We will have a seasonal system for 3 months and only applies on the Ranked Category. Those who are on the leaderboard will have a portion of the seasonal prize pool. So grind to the top to be the best weapon wielder of Mydoslyne.
